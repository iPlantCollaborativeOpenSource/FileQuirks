TrIDNet is an utility designed to identify file types from their binary
signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded rules,
TriID has no such rules. Instead, it is extensible and can be trained
to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way.

TrIDNet uses an XML-based database of definitions which describe
recurring patterns for supported file types.

You can help creating new definitions!
Just run the TrIDScan module against a number of files of a given type.
The program will do the rest.

N.B. You need to download the TrID/32 package (witch contains over 1.600
filetypes defs) to use this tool.

See the website for more info & changes log!


Required System: Win 98/ME/NT/2K/XP and .NET Framework installed
