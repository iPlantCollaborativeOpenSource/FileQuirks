  <h2>JSON output</h2>
  <p>
    It is possible to call the application as a webservice. Results are
    serialized in widely used JSON format. Example usage of JSON webservice is
    shown in the python script:
    <a href="{{BASE_URL}}/site-media/filequirks_json.py">download</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Results are returned in the form of dictionary. A file_type key is
    always set. If file_type is binary, result key contains only a sequence of
    binary type guessed.
  </p>
  <p>
    If file type is text, result contains a sequence of triplets: type name,
    score, Z-value. There is also exper_result key which may contain a sequence
    of triplets: type name, link to example file, link to regex match. A sample
    of file content is sent back in a file_content key.
