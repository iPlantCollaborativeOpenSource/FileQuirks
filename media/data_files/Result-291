TITLE
*602968 BREAST CARCINOMA AMPLIFIED SEQUENCE 1; BCAS1
;;NOVEL AMPLIFIED IN BREAST CANCER 1; NABC1
TEXT
Collins et al. (1998) studied the region of amplification on 20q13 that
had been demonstrated by comparative genomic hybridization studies to
contain copy-number gains in breast cancer and in several other forms of
cancer. Analysis of a 1-Mb region of recurrent amplification produced
evidence for 5 genes, of which 2, ZNF217 (602967) and NABC1, emerged as
strong candidate oncogenes. NABC1 (novel amplified in breast cancer-1)
was predicted to encode a 585-amino acid protein of unknown function and
was overexpressed in most but not all breast cancer cell lines in which
it was amplified.
