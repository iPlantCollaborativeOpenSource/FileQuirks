TEXT
See UBE2D1 (602961) for general information about ubiquitination and the
UBC4/5 subfamily of E2 enzymes.

By PCR using oligonucleotides based on UBCH5B (UBE2D2; 602962), Jensen
et al. (1995) identified a human peripheral blood lymphocyte cDNA
encoding UBCH5C, or UBE2D3. The predicted 147-amino acid UBCH5C and
UBCH5B proteins differ by only 4 amino acids, with 3 of the differences
conservative changes; the nucleotide sequences of their cDNAs are 87%
identical within the coding region and 23% conserved within the 3-prime
untranslated region. The UBCH5C protein has 94% sequence identity with
the Drosophila UbcD1 protein, 92% identity with C. elegans ubc2, 88%
identity with human UBCH5A (UBE2D1), and 79% identity with S. cerevisiae
UBC4 and UBC5, and Arabidopsis thaliana UBC8 and UBC9. Recombinant
UBCH5C expressed in E. coli had a molecular mass of 16 kD by SDS-PAGE.
The authors demonstrated that UBCH5C can conjugate ubiquitin to target
proteins in an E6AP (UBE3A; 601623)-dependent manner. Quantitative PCR
showed that UBCH5C was expressed in all human tissues examined and at
higher levels than UBCH5A and UBCH5B.
