gd; Acetylcholine is involved in the transfer of messages across a variety of
gd; synapses in vertebrates and invertebrates. The diverse physiological effects
gd; attributable to this molecule arise from the presence of specific receptors
gd; in the postsynaptic cell membranes. Several classes of receptor are known, 
gd; most of which translate the binding of acetylcholine into the opening of 
gd; channels for the passage of ions, such as sodium and potassium.
gd;
gd; Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of 
gd; acetylcholine to choline and acetate:
gd; 
gd;	     Acetylcholine + H(2)O -> Choline + Acetate 	     
gd; 
gd; The enzyme also acts on a variety of acetic esters and catalyses trans-
gd; acetylations. It is found in, or attached to, cellular or basement membranes
gd; of presynaptic cholinergic neurons and postsynaptic cholinoceptive cells.
gd; To prevent continuous firing of nerve impulses, acetylcholinesterase has a
gd; high K(cat) (~14000/s), to ensure that acetylcholine is broken down quickly.
gd;
gd; Cholinesterases constitute a family of enzymes that fall into two main
gd; types, depending on their substrate preference: enzymes that preferentially
gd; hydrolyse acetyl esters are termed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (EC 3.1.1.7); 
gd; and those that prefer other types of ester, such as butyrylcholine are 
gd; termed butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (EC 3.1.1.8). 
gd; 
gd; The 3D structure of acetylcholinesterase from the electric ray has been
gd; determined. The fold belongs to the alpha/beta class, with a 3-layer
gd; alpha-beta-alpha sandwich architecture.
gd;
gd; ACHEFISH is a 4-element fingerprint that provides a signature for fish
gd; acetylcholinesterases. The fingerprint was derived from an initial alignment
gd; of 4 sequences: the motifs were drawn from short conserved regions within
gd; the central portion of the alignment - motif 1 spans the N-terminus of 
gd; helix 12 and part of the preceding loop; motif 2 includes the N-terminal
gd; end of helix 14 and part of its preceding loop; motif 3 encompasses the 
gd; N-terminus of helix 18 and part of the preceding loop; and motif 4 encodes
gd; most of helix 19. Two iterations on OWL30.2 were required to reach
gd; convergence, at which point a true set comprising 6 sequences was identified.
gd;
gd; An update on SPTR37_9f identified a true set of 3 sequences.
