TITLE
*601963 TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT DOMAIN 1; TTC1
;;TETRATRICOPEPTIDE REPEAT-CONTAINING GENE 1; TPR1
TEXT
Tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) elements were first identified in 1990 as
34-amino acid degenerate repeating motifs encoded in the genes for
fungal proteins involved in the regulation of cell division and RNA
synthesis. Murthy et al. (1996) identified a gene they designated TPR1
via a 2-hybrid screen using a truncated neurofibromin (162200)
GAP-related segment as bait. TPR1 is ubiquitously expressed as a 1.6-kb
transcript encoding 3 tandem TPR motifs. The family of TPR-containing
proteins contains other members with diverse functions, including stress
response and interferon response (p58; 601184), mitochondrial and
peroxisomal protein import (see PEX5; 600414), tRNA synthesis,
neurogenesis in Drosophila, and components of the unactivated steroid
and estrogen receptors p59 (600611) and cyclophilin (see 601753). Murthy
et al. (1996) mapped the TPR1 gene to 5q32-q33.2 by Southern analysis of
genomic DNA from human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. See TPR2 (601964).
