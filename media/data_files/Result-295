TEXT

CLONING

The cDNA that encodes the 60-kD Ro/SSA autoantigen recognized by
autoantibodies in certain lupus erythematosus (152700) and Sjogren
syndrome (270150) sera was cloned and sequenced by Deutscher et al.
(1988) and confirmed with minor differences by Ben-Chetrit et al.
(1989).

GENE FUNCTION

Ro autoantigens are of clinical significance because antibodies directed
against them are found in most patients with primary Sjogren syndrome,
subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus erythematosus,
ANA-negative lupus erythematosus, and systemic lupus erythematosus-like
disease secondary to homozygous C2 or C4 complement deficiency (217000).
Ro antibody is a frequent cause of congenital heart block (234700).
Alspaugh and Tan (1975) described 3 types of precipitating antibodies in
the serum of Sjogren patients; they designated the 3 types as SS-A,
SS-B, and SS-C. SS-A antibodies were later shown to be immunologically
equivalent to the Ro antibodies. Hartung et al. (1992) found that the
presence of Ro antibody was strongly associated with HLA type DR3. La
antibodies (109090) showed the same association.

MAPPING

Frank and Mattei (1994) used in situ hybridization to demonstrate that
the RO60 gene maps to 1q31-q32.1 in the same region as the genes for
regulators of complement activation, e.g., CR1 (120620). By fluorescence
in situ hybridization, Chan et al. (1994) mapped the SSA2 gene to 1q31.
The gene encoding the 52-kD Ro/SSA autoantigen (SSA1; 109092) maps to
11p15.5.

ANIMAL MODEL

Antibodies against a conserved RNA-binding protein, the Ro60-kD
autoantigen, occur in 24 to 60% of all patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (152700). Anti-Ro antibodies are correlated with
photosensitivity and cutaneous lesions in these patients and with
neonatal lupus, a syndrome in which mothers with anti-Ro antibodies give
birth to children with complete congenital heart block (see 234700) and
photosensitive skin lesions. In higher eukaryotes, the Ro protein binds
small RNAs of unknown function known as Y RNAs. Because the Ro protein
also binds misfolded 5S rRNA precursors, it may function in a
quality-control pathway for ribosome biogenesis. Consistent with a role
in the recognition or repair of intracellular damage, an ortholog of Ro
in the radiation-resistant eubacterium Deinococcus radiodurans
contributes to survival of this bacterium after UV irradiation. Xue et
al. (2003) showed that mice lacking the Ro protein develop an autoimmune
syndrome characterized by anti-ribosome antibodies, antichromatin
antibodies, and glomerulonephritis. Moreover, in one strain background,
Ro -/- mice displayed increased sensitivity to irradiation with UV
light. Thus, one function of this major human autoantigen may be to
protect against autoantibody development, possibly by sequestering
defective ribonucleoproteins from immune surveillance. Furthermore, the
finding that mice lacking the Ro protein are photosensitive suggests
that loss of Ro function could contribute to the photosensitivity
associated with anti-Ro antibodies in humans.
