COMMENT     REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
            reference sequence was derived from BC003370.1 and AF208234.1.
            
            Summary: The cystatin superfamily encompasses proteins that contain
            multiple cystatin-like sequences. Some of the members are active
            cysteine protease inhibitors, while others have lost or perhaps
            never acquired this inhibitory activity. There are three inhibitory
            families in the superfamily, including the type 1 cystatins
            (stefins), type 2 cystatins and kininogens. This gene encodes a
            stefin that functions as an intracellular thiol protease inhibitor.
            The protein is able to form a dimer stabilized by noncovalent
            forces, inhibiting papain and cathepsins l, h and b. The protein is
            thought to play a role in protecting against the proteases leaking
            from lysosomes. Evidence indicates that mutations in this gene are
            responsible for the primary defects in patients with progressive
            myoclonic epilepsy (EPM1). [provided by RefSeq].
