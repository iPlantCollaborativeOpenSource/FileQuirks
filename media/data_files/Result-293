TEXT

CLONING

Boucher et al. (1995) identified SIX5 as a homeodomain protein gene
downstream (centromeric) of the (CTG)n repeat in the DMPK gene (160900).
RT-PCR analysis showed that the SIX5 gene, which they called DMAHP, is
expressed in a number of human tissues, including skeletal muscle,
heart, and brain.

GENE FUNCTION

Heath et al. (1997) used 2 different strategies to examine expression of
the murine homolog of the DMAHP gene. The first approach, RT-PCR,
detected spliced transcripts in a wide range of embryonic and adult
tissues, in a pattern overlapping substantially with the expression of
mouse DMPK. A second approach, the generation of transgenic mice
expressing a lacZ reporter gene from a 4.3-kb DMAHP promoter fragment,
also demonstrated expression in a range of tissues with potential links
to the phenotype in myotonic dystrophy. They concluded that murine DMAHP
has a similar pattern of expression to human DMAHP and that the mouse
can serve as a useful model for functional studies of this gene,
although species differences, such as the reduced CpG island (1.8 kb
compared with 3.5 kb), must be kept in mind.

Myotonic dystrophy (160900) is a highly variable multisystem disease in
which the classic adult-onset form displays progressive muscle wasting
with myotonia, cataracts, heart block, gonadal atrophy, insulin
resistance, and neuropsychiatric impairment. Its genetic basis is an
expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats in the DMPK protein kinase gene,
though the pathophysiologic mechanism for multisystem degeneration in DM
had yet to be defined. Among the triplet repeat expansion disorders,
myotonic dystrophy is distinguished by the extended length of the repeat
tract (5 to 13 kb in postmortem tissue) and its location in the 3-prime
untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Thornton et al. (1997) noted that,
in contrast to the profound muscle wasting that characterizes advanced
myotonic dystrophy, only minor histopathologic abnormalities were found
in DMPK knockout mice or in mice that overexpress a human DMPK
transgene, making it unlikely that changes in DMPK activity provide a
unitary explanation for the disease. Otten and Tapscott (1995)
demonstrated that a DNase I (300081)-hypersensitive site located
adjacent to the repeats on the wildtype allele is eliminated by repeat
expansion, suggesting that large CTG-repeat arrays may be associated
with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression.
Klesert et al. (1997) reported that the hypersensitive site contains an
enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP
homeobox gene. Analysis of DMAHP expression in cells of myotonic
dystrophy patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a 2- to
4-fold reduction in the steady-state DMAHP transcript levels relative to
wildtype controls. Allele-specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed
that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were
greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wildtype allele. Along
the same line, Thornton et al. (1997) showed that DMAHP expression in
myoblasts, muscle, and myocardium was reduced by the DM mutation in cis,
and the magnitude of this effect depended on the extent of the CTG
repeat expansion. These observations supported the hypothesis that DMAHP
participates in the pathophysiology of DM.

Since the DM-associated (CTG)n repeat is located in the promoter region
of SIX5, immediately downstream of DMPK, Winchester et al. (1999)
hypothesized that dysfunction of this gene, which is homologous to the
Drosophila eye development gene 'sine oculis,' is primarily responsible
for the ophthalmic features of DM. The multicolored iridescent cataract
is the most prominent feature of the eye pathology in DM. It is often
the first and in some cases the only sign of the disease, occurring at a
younger age than is expected for senile cataracts, and occurring in
persons who show no muscle symptoms or who carry a premutation (CTG)n
repeat allele. In an analysis of the expression of DMPK and SIX5 in
normal human fetal and adult eyes, Winchester et al. (1999) found SIX5
transcripts in the adult corneal epithelium and endothelium, lens
epithelium, ciliary body epithelia, cellular layers of the retina, and
the sclera. SIX5 expression was not detected in fetal eyes. They also
reported a restricted but partially overlapping expression pattern for
DMPK transcripts and DMPK protein in normal fetal and adult eyes.
Winchester et al. (1999) concluded that the expression of SIX5 and not
DMPK in the adult lens indicated a role for SIX5 dysfunction in the
development of adult-onset cataracts, the most frequently occurring eye
phenotype in DM.

MAPPING

Boucher et al. (1995) identified the SIX5 gene in chromosome 19q13.3,
centromeric to the DMPK gene (605377).

MOLECULAR GENETICS

Branchiootorenal syndrome (BOR2; 610896) is an autosomal dominant
developmental disorder characterized by the association of branchial
arch defects, hearing loss, and renal anomalies. Mutations in the EYA1
gene (601653) were identified as a cause of the BOR syndrome. A member
of the SIX family of proteins, unc-39 (SIX5), was found to interact
directly with eya-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans as identified by
high-throughput, yeast 2-hybrid analysis (Li et al., 2004). Hoskins et
al. (2007) hypothesized that this interaction would be conserved in
humans and that interactors of EYA1 represent good candidate genes for
BOR. They therefore screened a cohort of 95 patients with BOR for
mutations in SIX5. Four different heterozygous missense mutations were
identified in 5 individuals with BOR2. Functional analyses of these
mutations demonstrated that 2 mutations (600963.0001, 600963.0004)
affected EYA1-SIX5 binding and the ability of SIX5 or the EYA1-SIX5
complex to activate gene transcription.

ANIMAL MODEL

Klesert et al. (2000) replaced the first exon of Six5 with a
beta-galactosidase reporter gene. Histochemical detection of
beta-galactosidase activity demonstrated expression as early as 8.5 days
postcoitum in the anterior neural folds. Between 10.5 and 15.5 days
postcoitum, there was low expression in smooth muscle of stomach,
esophagus, and urogenital sinus, and in skeletal muscle of the tongue,
as well as scattered expression in the myotome and developing limb
muscle. A higher level of expression was seen in the sclerotome,
meninges, adrenal gland, and cartilagenous areas of developing bones and
trachea. In the eye, expression was evident in the retina, the cornea,
the vasculature on the posterior surface of the lens, and faintly in the
lens-fiber layer. There was no reliable expression detected in the adult
mouse. Disruption of Six5 function did not affect viability or
fertility. Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of
skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular opacities at a higher
rate than controls. Klesert et al. (2000) concluded that Six5 deficiency
contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that
myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder.

Sarkar et al. (2000) also studied Six5 expression in mouse. By in situ
hybridization, they detected Six5 expression in the adult corneal
epithelium and endothelium, inner and outer epithelium of the ciliary
body, anterior lens epithelium, ganglion cells, cells of the inner
nuclear layer, and photoreceptor cells of the retina. Sarkar et al.
(2000) deleted the entire Six5 gene and replaced it with a neo cassette.
They found that the rate and severity of cataract formation was
inversely related to Six5 dosage and was temporally progressive. Six5
+/- and Six5 -/- mice showed increased steady-state levels of the
sodium-potassium-ATPase alpha-1 subunit (182310) and decreased Dm15 mRNA
levels. Sarkar et al. (2000) suggested that altered ion homeostasis
within the lens may contribute to cataract formation. As ocular
cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM, these results demonstrated
that decreased Six5 transcription is important in the etiology of DM.
The authors concluded that their data supported the hypothesis that DM
is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both
DMPK and SIX5.

Sato et al. (2002) overexpressed a constitutively active form of Six5 in
murine P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Using expression profiling in cDNA
arrays, they identified 21 potential target genes whose expression level
increased by the treatment. Genes expressed in the somites, skeletal
muscles, brain, and meninges comprised the majority, suggesting a role
for Six5 in the development and function of mesodermal tissues and
brain. One of these genes, Igfbp5 (146734), was also decreased in
Six5-deficient mouse fibroblasts, and the response of human IGFBP5 to
MyoD (159970)-induced muscle conversion was altered in cells of DM
patients. The authors concluded that Six5 is an activator that directs
Igfbp5 expression, and hypothesized that reduced SIX5 expression in DM
contributes to the DM phenotype.

The CTG expansion causing DM results in transcriptional silencing of the
flanking SIX5 allele. Sarkar et al. (2004) generated Six5 knockout and
heterozygous mice by targeted disruption and demonstrated a strict
requirement of Six5 for both spermatogenic cell survival and
spermiogenesis. Leydig cell hyperproliferation and increased
intratesticular testosterone levels were observed in the Six5 -/- mice.
Although increased FSH (see 136530) levels were observed in the Six5 +/-
and Six5 -/- mice, serum testosterone levels and intratesticular inhibin
alpha (INHA; 147380) and inhibin beta-B (INHBB; 147390) levels were not
altered in the Six5 mutant animals when compared with controls.
Steady-state c-Kit (164920) levels were reduced in the Six5 -/- testis.
The authors concluded that decreased c-Kit levels could contribute to
the elevated spermatogenic cell apoptosis and Leydig cell
hyperproliferation in the Six5 -/- mice. They hypothesized that the
reduced SIX5 levels may contribute to the male reproductive defects in
DM1.

ALLELIC VARIANTS
.0001
BRANCHIOOTORENAL SYNDROME 2
SIX5, ALA158THR

In a patient with branchiootorenal syndrome (610896) manifesting
bilateral dysplastic kidneys and preauricular tag on the right but no
hearing loss, Hoskins et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 472G-A
transition in the SIX5 gene that resulted in an ala158-to-thr (A158T)
amino acid substitution. Using yeast 2-hybrid analysis and luciferase
assays, Hoskins et al. (2007) showed that this mutation reduced
EYA1-SIX5 binding and the ability of the EYA1-SIX5 complex to activate
gene transcription.

.0002
BRANCHIOOTORENAL SYNDROME 2
SIX5, ALA296THR 

In a patient with a clinical diagnosis of branchiootorenal syndrome
(610896) who had bilateral dysplastic kidneys and reduced renal
function, bilateral hearing loss and cervical fistulae, and right-sided
hemifacial microsomia, preauricular sinus, and pinna malformation,
Hoskins et al. (2007) identified a heterozygous 886G-A transition in the
SIX5 gene that resulted in an ala296-to-thr (A296T) amino acid
substitution.

.0003
BRANCHIOOTORENAL SYNDROME 2
SIX5, GLY365ARG 

In a patient with a clinical diagnosis of branchiootorenal syndrome
(610896), Hoskins et al. (2007) found a heterozygous 1093G-A transition
in the SIX5 gene that resulted in a gly365-to-arg (G365R) amino acid
substitution.

.0004
BRANCHIOOTORENAL SYNDROME 2
SIX5, THR552MET

In 2 unrelated patients with the BOR syndrome (610896), Hoskins et al.
(2007) found heterozygosity for the same missense mutation in the SIX5
gene, a 1655C-T transition that resulted in a thr552-to-met (T552M)
substitution. One patient had no hearing loss but had bilateral
hypoplastic kidneys and cervical fistulae; the second patient had
agenesis of the left kidney and hypoplasia of the right kidney,
bilateral cervical fistulae, and bilateral hearing loss. Using yeast
2-hybrid analysis and luciferase assays, Hoskins et al. (2007) showed
that this mutation reduced EYA1-SIX5 binding and the ability of the
EYA1-SIX5 complex to activate gene transcription.
