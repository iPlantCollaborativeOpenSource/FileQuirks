gd; Chloride channels (CLCs) constitute an evolutionarily well-conserved family
gd; of voltage-gated channels that are structurally unrelated to the other known
gd; voltage-gated channels. They are found in organisms ranging from bacteria to
gd; yeasts and plants, and also to animals. Their functions in higher animals
gd; likely include the regulation of cell volume, control of electrical 
gd; excitability and trans-epithelial transport [1].
gd; 
gd; The first member of the family (CLC-0) was expression-cloned from the
gd; electric organ of Torpedo marmorata [2], and subsequently nine CLC-like
gd; proteins have been cloned from mammals. They are thought to function as
gd; multimers of two or more identical or homologous subunits, and they have
gd; varying tissue distributions and functional properties. To date, CLC-0, 
gd; CLC-1, CLC-2, CLC-4 and CLC-5 have been demonstrated to form functional Cl-
gd; channels; whether the remaining isoforms do so is either contested or 
gd; unproven. One possible explanation for the difficulty in expressing 
gd; activatable Cl- channels is that some of the isoforms may function as Cl- 
gd; channels of intracellular compartments, rather than of the plasma membrane.
gd; However, they are all thought to have a similar transmembrane (TM) topology,
gd; initial hydropathy analysis suggesting 13 hydrophobic stretches long enough
gd; to form putative TM domains [2]. Recently, the postulated TM topology has
gd; been revised, and it now seems likely that the CLCs have 10 (or possibly 12)
gd; TM domains, with both N- and C-termini residing in the cytoplasm [3].
gd; 
gd; A number of human disease-causing mutations have been identified in the
gd; genes encoding CLCs. Mutations in CLCN1, the gene encoding CLC-1, the major
gd; skeletal muscle Cl- channel, lead to both recessively and dominantly-
gd; inherited forms of muscle stiffness or myotonia [4]. Similarly, mutations
gd; in CLCN5, which encodes CLC-5, a renal Cl- channel, lead to several forms 
gd; of inherited kidney stone disease [5]. These mutations have been
gd; demonstrated to reduce or abolish CLC function.
gd; 
gd; CLC-0 is the principal Cl- channel of the electric organ of the Torpedo
gd; species. These marine electric rays generate high voltage pulses (to stun
gd; their prey) by the concerted action of Cl- channels and nicotinic acetyl-
gd; choline receptors, in specialised cells known as electrocytes. The
gd; properties of the CLC-0 channel (consisting of 805-809 amino acids) have
gd; been extensively studied after reconstitution into lipid bilayers. It has
gd; a peculiar double-barrelled structure, appearing to have two identical ion
gd; pores that close and open independently, but which can be also closed
gd; together by another common gate. Further evidence also suggests it may
gd; function as a homodimer [6,7].
gd;
gd; CLCHANNEL0 is a 5-element fingerprint that provides a signature for the 
gd; CLC-0 voltage-gated Cl- channel. The fingerprint was derived from an initial
gd; alignment of 2 sequences: the motifs were drawn from conserved regions
gd; within the N-terminal half of the alignment, focusing on those sections
gd; that characterise the CLC-0 isoform but distinguish it from others -
gd; motifs 1-3 reside within the putative cytoplasmic N-terminus; and motifs 4
gd; and 5 lie within the ninth and tenth, hydrophilic domains, respectively.
gd; A single iteration on SPTR37_9f was required to reach convergence, no
gd; further sequences being identified beyond the starting set.
